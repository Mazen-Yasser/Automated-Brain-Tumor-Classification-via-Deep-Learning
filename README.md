## ðŸ“– Project Overview

This project presents a deep learning solution for the automated classification of brain tumors from MRI scans. The model is trained to accurately distinguish between four categories: *glioma, **meningioma, **pituitary tumor, and **no tumor*. By leveraging modern Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures and advanced data augmentation techniques, this project aims to provide a reliable tool to assist in medical diagnosis.

The transition from a fast.ai implementation to a pure PyTorch and timm framework allows for greater flexibility, more granular control over the training process, and access to a wider range of state-of-the-art pretrained models.

## âœ¨ Key Features

* *High Accuracy:* Achieves high classification accuracy using a powerful ConvNeXt model.
* *Modern Architecture:* Utilizes the timm library to implement ConvNeXt, a state-of-the-art vision model.
* *Advanced Augmentation:* Employs the albumentations library for a robust set of image augmentations, making the model resilient to variations in MRI scans.
* *End-to-End Pipeline:* Provides a complete pipeline from data loading and preprocessing to training, validation, and visualization.
* *Clear Visualizations:* Generates easy-to-understand plots for training history, individual predictions, and a confusion matrix for performance evaluation.
